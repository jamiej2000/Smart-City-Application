# Smart-City-Application
This application was designed for a city council to provide updates regarding tourism, job postings, and student information.

It connects to a SQL database (Uses default MySQL settings) and allows an administrator to add, remove, edit or search for a post.
Clients are able to view three different 'message boards'(Job postings, student information and updates regarding tourism.)

If the client cannot connect to the database, ensure the SQL server is running correctly on the default settings (localhost@3306)
NOTE - Password/username used for SQL database is "root"/"root" and your server must be set to this to work.

The database requires a username/password form that includes three fields: "idUser", "username", and "password" to succesfully log on.
